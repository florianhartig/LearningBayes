## Synopsis 

This teaching material on Bayesian Statistics originated mostly from a series of introductory course on Bayesian statistics that I have held over the last years together with various subsets of [Jörn Pagel](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/person/joern-pagel), [Joseph Chipperfield](http://josephchipperfield.wordpress.com/) and [Björn Reineking](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bjoern_Reineking), and [Felix May](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=32342). I will announce any upcoming courses [at my blog](https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/florianhartig?lang=en).

## Topics, lecture notes and code

A collection of commented code examples on concepts and applications is here [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode). These example span the range of topics that we typically cover, including

* Concepts of Bayesian statistics (Priors, Likelihoods, etc.). Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/01-Principles)
* Sampling algorithms (MCMC, SMC). Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/02-Samplers)
* The Bugs model language and its implementations in JAGS, STAN and OpenBugs. Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/03-Software)
* Standard statistical models with Bayes. Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/04-StandardModels)
  * (Generalized) linear models (G)LM
  * (Generalized) linear mixed models (G)LMM
* Advanced model types. Code examples [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/05-HierarchicalAndSpatialModels)
  * Spatial models 
  * State-space models 
* Bayesian model analysis and checks - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/06-BayesianModelChecking)
* Model selection and averaging - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/07-BayesianModelSelectionAveraging)
* Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/08-ApproximateBayesian)
* Process-based models and Bayes - [code](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/tree/master/CommentedCode/09-BayesAndProcessBasedModels)

I'm working on providing proper lecture notes for this course. For the moment, I'm recommending as an introduction the free lecture notes [Bayesian Basics by Michael Clark](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/micl/miscfiles/IntroBayes.pdf). For further reading see the textbooks and articles suggested [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/LearningBayes/blob/master/LectureNotes/readings.md).
