# Continue with the previous model in 1.2-B in groups of 2-3 people

# Exercise 1 – discuss in groups of 2 how you would set priors in this example for a research paper on the correlation of Ozone ~ Temp

# Exercise 2 – so far, we removed NA. Try out what happens when we don't do this in the Jags model, and discuss the results. Have you heard about imputation techniques? Is what happens here similar to multiple imputation? For imputation, see https://theoreticalecology.github.io/AdvancedRegressionModels/3A-MissingData.html#imputation
