This course provides a practical introduction to Bayesian inference covering both the theory and application of Bayesian methods using a number of examples motivated from the biological and environmental sciences, including

-   Introduction to concepts of Bayesian statistics (Priors, Likelihoods, etc.)
-   Sampling methods (e.g. Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and model specification languages and frameworks (STAN, brms, BayesianTools)
-   Workflow of Bayesian inference, including model checks, model specification etc.
-   Bayesian model choice and model selection
-   Discussion of common hierarchical model structures, including mixed models, error in variable models, etc.

This material assumes prior knowledge of standard statistical methods and concepts (tests, regressions, p-value, power, CIs, ...) and the ability to apply those in R. At the University of Regensburg, this knowledge would be taught in the Bachelors Biology Lecture "Statistik und Bioinformatik" (lecture notes in German [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nefr3bteve5lym7/GrundlagenDerStatistik.pdf?dl=0)), and the block course "Introduction to statistics in R". If you didn't take those or comparable courses, you should at least try to get some basic understanding of R before proceeding with this book. On top of that, a good grasp of GLMMs would be helpful for following this course. As a reference, have at my lecture notes on for the course [Advanced Regression Models](https://theoreticalecology.github.io/AdvancedRegressionModels/).

I want to acknowledge that much of this material was inspired by a serious of courses and summer schools that I did in various combinations of people, but mostly with my colleagues Jörn Page, Joe Chipperfield and Björn Reineking. Those past courses inlcuded
